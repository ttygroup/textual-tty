# textual-tty

A terminal emulator for Textual apps, using `bittty`, my pure Python terminal
emulator.

Currently buggy and a bit slow, but it's still somewhat usable.

## Demo

```bash
uvx textual-tty
```

## Usage

1. `TextualTerminal`, a bittty.Terminal subclass for textual.
2. `TerminalApp`, a terminal emulator in a window.

Read the demo code for more info.
